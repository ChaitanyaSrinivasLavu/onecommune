# Concept of One Commune
One Commune is envisioned as a platform to connect users within a geographical vicinity, fostering local community interactions. The application allows users to join a community based on their location, discover nearby users, connect with them, and communicate through a simple chat interface.

# Features of One Commune
1. User Location Submission
  Input Form: Users input their geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude).
  Data Handling: The coordinates are captured and sent to the server for processing.
2. Storing and Displaying Nearby Users
  User List: The server maintains an in-memory list of user coordinates.
  Distance Calculation: Using Geopy, the application calculates the distance between users to determine proximity.
  Nearby Users Display: Users within a 10km radius are displayed on the Nearby Users page.
3. Connecting with Nearby Users
  Connection Page: Users can select a nearby user to connect with.
  User Information: Displays the selected userâ€™s location for context.
4. Chat Functionality
  Messaging: Users can send and receive messages with other users.
  Message Storage: Messages are temporarily stored in an in-memory list for simplicity.
  Chat Interface: The chat interface displays the message history for the conversation.

# Detailed Technical Workflow
1. Home Page (index.html)
Functionality: Collects user location via a form.
Flow: On submission, data is sent to /submit_location.
2. Submit Location Endpoint (/submit_location)
Data Processing: Receives and processes user-submitted location.
User List Update: Adds the new location to the user list.
Redirection: Redirects to the Nearby Users page with the user's location as a parameter.
3. Nearby Users Page (/nearby_users)
Location Extraction: Extracts the user's location from the query parameters.
Proximity Calculation: Uses Geopy to find users within a 10km radius.
Display: Renders a list of nearby users with "Connect" buttons.
4. Connect Page (/connect/<latitude>/<longitude>)
User Connection: Displays selected user's location and offers a "Chat Now" button.
Navigation: Allows navigation back to Nearby Users or the Home page.
5. Chat Page (/chat/<latitude>/<longitude>)
Message Form: Provides a form for users to send messages.
Message Handling: Stores messages and displays the message history related to the conversation.

# Implementation Details
1. Flask Framework: Handles routing, form submission, and rendering HTML templates.
2. Geopy Library: Calculates distances between user locations.
3. HTML Templates: Uses Jinja2 templating engine for dynamic content rendering.
