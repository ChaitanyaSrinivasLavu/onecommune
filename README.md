# onecommune

Concept of One Commune
One Commune is envisioned as a platform to connect users within a geographical vicinity, fostering local community interactions. The application allows users to join a community based on their location, discover nearby users, connect with them, and communicate through a simple chat interface.

Features of One Commune
1. User Location Submission
Input Form: Users input their geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude).
Data Handling: The coordinates are captured and sent to the server for processing.
2. Storing and Displaying Nearby Users
User List: The server maintains an in-memory list of user coordinates.
Distance Calculation: Using Geopy, the application calculates the distance between users to determine proximity.
Nearby Users Display: Users within a 10km radius are displayed on the Nearby Users page.
3. Connecting with Nearby Users
Connection Page: Users can select a nearby user to connect with.
User Information: Displays the selected userâ€™s location for context.
4. Chat Functionality
Messaging: Users can send and receive messages with other users.
Message Storage: Messages are temporarily stored in an in-memory list for simplicity.
Chat Interface: The chat interface displays the message history for the conversation.
